          This educational platform hosts a collection of interactive mini-games
          designed to make English learning engaging, visual, and fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each game focuses on a unique language skill â€” from building
          sentences, matching pictures, and spotting grammar mistakes, to
          learning idioms and rhyming words. All games share a unified layout
          and smooth transitions powered by <strong>Framer Motion</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system is built with <strong>Next.js 14</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>React 18</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, using
          modern libraries like <strong>Zustand</strong> for state management
          and <strong>React Query</strong> for API integration.
        </p>

        <p>
          This modular architecture allows every game â€” such as{" "}
          <em>Sentence Shuffle</em>, <em>Double Vision</em>, and{" "}
          <em>WordWise Flash</em> â€” to live as an independent React component
          inside a shared ecosystem.
        </p>

          ðŸŽ¯ The mission: make learning English playful, intuitive, and
          rewarding.
